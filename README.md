# kotlin-vertx-react
try to make a skeleton project based on kotlin multiple platform(jvm and js, webassemply maybe in future)

Basically, Use vertx as backend, in details,
vertx-web as web layer
vert-sql-jdbc and Exposed as DB layer 
mainly based on https://github.com/oripwk/kotlin-vertx-example as example 

Use react as frontend, will call backend Rest Service. But doesn't use NodeJs, try to use Vertx Static Handler to server all client files.
